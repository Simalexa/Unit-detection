1. Units positions are stored in the file "map.txt" and "map(10000units).txt" in format:
Sektor _alpha_ degree, _distane_ R   //for first line
Units Name I, positio (x,y), dirrection (Vx, Vy)  //for the all next lines
2. File "map(10000units).txt" generated with using randome function; units dirrection further normilized in the program
3. Multithreaded programming with two threaded was used to build the solution
4. All the results was stored in the file "results.txt".
